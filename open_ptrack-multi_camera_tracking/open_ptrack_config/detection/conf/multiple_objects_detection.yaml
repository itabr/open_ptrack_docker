##for camshift, for the window in backproject image,the value represent the similirity with the ROI. the value of the pixel is equal to 255*percentage ,the percentage come from the histogram(problility)
## QUALITY_TOLERANCE here means the TOLERANCE of sum of the window in backproject image,it represent the quality of the window.
## DENSITY_TOLORENCE here means the TOLERANCE of the DENSITY,DENSITY=QUALITY/window.area();
## AREA_TOLERANCE here means the TOLERANCE of the x,y ,window.it means the objects maybe apprear in the next frame ,in the window which increase it's size by AREA_TOLERANCE every frame.so the bigger AREA_TOLERANCE,the objects can move faster.
## if the QUALITY<QUALITY_TOLERANCE, the object is "totally occluded",
## then when QUALITY<QUALITY_TOLERANCE, it will appeare, but at first ,not totaly appear,the window may be much bigger then the size of object,
## then we calculate the DENSITY,if DENSITY<DENSITY_TOLORENCE.it means the window not just included the object,and the objects are "half occluded"
## then the camshift will decrese the size of the window,untill DENSITY>DENSITY_TOLORENCE,it will be "not occluded";
AREA_TOLERANCE: 20  ##AREA_TOLERANCE is also used to create the position_maks
QUALITY_TOLERANCE: 20000
DENSITY_TOLORENCE: 2.0
